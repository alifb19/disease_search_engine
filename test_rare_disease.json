    "name": "Aarskog Syndrome",
    "introduction": "General Discussion \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Aarskog syndrome is a rare genetic condition characterized by short stature and multiple facial, limb and genital abnormalities. Additionally, some types of cognitive disorders may occasionally be present. Up to now, the  FGD1  gene on the X chromosome is the only gene known to be associated with Aarskog syndrome.",
    "symptoms": "Signs &amp; Symptoms \n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Aarskog syndrome primarily affects males. Affected boys exhibit a characteristic set of facial, skeletal, and genital abnormalities. Clinical signs may vary from person to person (clinical heterogeneity), even within families. Males with Aarskog syndrome often have a rounded face with a broad forehead. Additional characteristic facial features include widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism), drooping (ptosis) of the eyelids, downwardly slanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures), a small nose with nostrils that are flared forward (anteverted nares), an underdeveloped upper jawbone (maxilliary hypoplasia), and a widow’s peak. Affected individuals may also have an abnormally long groove in the upper lip (philtrum) and a broad nasal bridge. \n These children may also have a variety of abnormalities affecting the ears and teeth. Ear abnormalities include low-set ears and thickened, “fleshy” earlobes. Dental abnormalities include missing teeth at birth, delayed eruption of teeth, and underdevelopment of the hard outer covering of teeth (enamel hypoplasia). \n Aarskog syndrome is basically a skeletal dysplasia and affected males develop characteristic malformations of the skeletal system including disproportionate short stature; broad, short hands and feet; short, stubby fingers (brachydactyly) with permanent fixation of the fifth fingers in a bent position (clinodactyly); abnormally extendible finger joints; and wide flat feet with bulbous toes. In addition, affected individuals may have a sunken chest (pectus excavatum), protrusion of portions of the large intestine through an abnormal opening in the muscular lining of the abdominal cavity (inguinal hernia), and a prominent navel (umbilicus). Individuals with Aarskog syndrome may have spinal abnormalities such as incomplete closure of the bones of the spinal column (spina bifida occulta), fusion of the upper bones of the spinal column (cervical vertebrae), and underdevelopment of the “peg-like” projection of the second cervical vertebra (odontoid hypoplasia). \n A sign that helps to make a diagnosis in males with Aarskog syndrome are the genital abnormalities, including a characteristic abnormal fold of skin extending around the base of the penis (“shawl” scrotum) and/or failure of one or both of the testes to descend into the scrotum (cryptorchidism). In addition, the urinary opening (meatus) may be located on the underside of the penis (hypospadias) and the scrotum may appear clefted or divided (bifid scrotum). \n Intellectual disability has been described in some affected boys but it is not a consistent feature of the disorder. Affected individuals may present with a range of mild learning difficulty and/or behavioral disorders: affected children may exhibit developmental delay during infancy, hyperactivity, attention deficit, impulsivity and opposition. Failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive) and development of chronic respiratory infections have also been described. \n An additional spectrum of signs and/or symptoms may occur less frequently, including congenital heart defects; abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis); additional pairs of ribs; incomplete closure of the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) and/or a vertical groove in the upper lip (cleft lip); mild webbing of the fingers; and a short neck with or without webbing. Additional eye abnormalities may be present including crossed eyes (strabismus), farsightedness (hyperopia), and paralysis of certain eye muscles (ophthalmoplegia).",
    "causes": "Causes \n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Although Aarskog syndrome is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition, the best characterized form of the disorder is inherited as an X-linked trait and caused by changes (mutations) in the  FGD1  gene. Aarskog syndrome primarily affects males. However, females who carry a single copy of a  FGD1  gene mutation (heterozygotes) may exhibit some of the symptoms associated with the disorder.  FGD1  gene mutations have been identified in approximately 22% of affected males, therefore, it is likely that other genes not yet identified may also be associated with this condition. \n X-linked recessive genetic disorders are conditions caused by mutations in a gene located on the X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes but one of the X chromosomes is “turned off” to correct a dosage imbalance and almost all of the genes on that chromosome are silenced (inactivated) through a process defined as X-chromosome inactivation. Females who have a disease causing mutation on one of their X chromosomes are carriers for that disorder. Carrier females usually do not display symptoms of the disorder because it is usually the X chromosome with the abnormal gene that is “silenced”. Males have one only X chromosome and, if they inherit the X chromosome that contains a disease gene, they will develop the disease. In turn, males with a X-linked disorder will pass the disease gene to all of their daughters, who will be carriers of the trait (obligate carriers). Males cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons because they always pass their Y chromosome instead of their X chromosome to male offspring. Female carriers of an X-linked disorder have a 25% chance with each pregnancy to have a carrier daughter (like themselves), a 25% chance to have a non-carrier daughter, a 25% chance to have a son affected with the disease, and a 25% chance to have an unaffected son.",
    "treatment": "Standard Therapies \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    Treatment  \nThe treatment of Aarskog syndrome is directed toward the specific symptoms that are apparent in each individual. Treatment may require the coordinated efforts of a team of specialists. Pediatricians, surgeons, cardiologists, dental specialists, speech pathologists, specialists who asses and treat hearing problems (audiologists), eye specialists, and other health care professionals may need to systematically and comprehensively plan an affected child’s treatment. \n Surgery may be necessary to treat specific congenital or structural malformations sometimes associated with Aarskog syndrome (hypospadias, inguinal or umbilical hernias, cryptorchidism, unusually severe craniofacial features). Individuals with Aarskog syndrome should receive complete eye and dental evaluations. Growth hormone treatment has been reported to improve height in some children, but confirmation is needed to determine appropriate management and expectations for response. For the possibly neurodevelopmental symptoms, a neuropsychiatric evaluation and input may be indicated. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive. \n Genetic counseling is recommended for affected individuals and their families to clarify the genetic and clinical characteristics, the inheritance, and the recurrence risks of the condition in their families.",

    "name": "Achondrogenesis",
    "introduction": "General Discussion \n\t\t\t\t\t\t  Summary  \r\n Achondrogenesis is a group of rare skeletal dysplasias characterized by extreme shortening of the arms and legs in relation to the trunk, abnormal development of ribs, vertebra and other skeletal abnormalities. The health problems associated with these conditions are life-threatening and most affected infants are stillborn or die shortly after birth due to respiratory failure. All types of achondrogenesis are genetic conditions; type IA and type IB, are autosomal recessive disorders, whereas achondrogenesis type II is an autosomal dominant disorder. All types of achondrogenesis are very severe skeletal dysplasias usually detected by prenatal ultrasound examination as early as week 14-17 of gestational age. \r\n  Introduction  \r\n The term achondrogenesis was first used in the medical literature in 1952 by an Italian pathologist named Marco Fraccaro. Achondrogenesis is derived from Greek and means \"not producing cartilage.\" Achondrogenesis belongs to group of skeletal dysplasias, (also called osteochondrodysplasias), a broad term for a group of disorders (about 450 clinical diagnoses) characterized by abnormal growth or development of cartilage and bone.",
    "symptoms": "Signs &amp; Symptoms \n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Achondrogenesis is characterized by premature birth, abnormal accumulation of fluid in the body (hydrops fetalis), and a head that may be abnormal in shape and less ossified. The head may look disproportionately large, because the body is small. In addition, affected individuals have extremely short limbs and ribs, short neck, flat vertebrae and many other bones of the skeleton are not properly developed. In infants born with this disorder the abdomen is prominent and the thoracic cage is small. Other abnormalities are incomplete closure of the roof of the mouth (cleft palate), corneal clouding, and ear deformities. The disorder is life-threatening either before birth or shortly after birth usually due to underdeveloped thorax and small lungs. \n Achondrogenesis type IA (Houston-Harris type) is characterized by varying facial abnormalities (flat face, protruding eyes and protruding tongue or only minor facial anomalies), short trunk and limbs, short beaded ribs and thin skull bones (deficient ossification of the skull). Bone formation is abnormal in the spine, pelvis and extremities, but the degree of the severity of skeletal involvement may be variable. However, small thorax leads to underdevelopment of lungs and death soon after birth. \n Achondrogenesis type IB (Fraccaro type) is characterized by short trunk and limbs, narrow chest, and prominent abdomen. Affected infants may have a protrusion around the belly-button (umbilical hernia), or near the groin (inguinal hernia), and have short fingers and toes with feet turned inward. The face may be flat, the palate may be cleft and the neck is usually short. In some cases, the soft tissue of the neck may be abnormally thickened. Achondrogenesis type IB is sub-classified as a sulfation disorder, a small group of disorders associated with mutations in the gene  SLC26A2 . This group includes diastrophic dysplasia and recessive multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, which are milder conditions. It is important to note that one diagnosis does not change to another while the baby is developing, even if the genetic changes are located in the same gene. \n Achondrogenesis type II (Langer-Saldino type) is characterized by a narrow chest, abnormally small or short bones in the arms and/or legs, thin ribs, flat vertebra or deficient ossification of vertebral bodies, underdeveloped lungs, small chin, cleft palate and club feet. Bone formation is abnormal in the spine and pelvis. Abnormal accumulation of fluid may occur (hydrops fetalis) and the abdomen may be enlarged.",
    "causes": "Causes \n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Each type of achondrogenesis is caused by a mutation in a specific gene. Genes provide instructions for creating proteins that play a critical role in many functions of the body. When a mutation of a gene occurs, the protein product may be faulty, inefficient, or absent. Depending upon the functions of the particular protein, this can affect many organ systems of the body. \n The gene mutations that cause achondrogenesis type IA and type IB are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Recessive genetic disorders occur when an individual inherits two copies of an abnormal gene for the same trait, one from each parent. If an individual receives one normal gene and one gene for the disease, the person is a carrier for the disease but usually will not show symptoms. The risk for two carrier parents to have an affected child is 25% with each pregnancy. The risk to have a child who is a carrier like the parents is 50% with each pregnancy. The chance for a child to receive normal genes from both parents is 25%. The risk is the same for males and females. \n All individuals carry several abnormal genes. Parents who are close relatives (consanguineous) have a higher chance than non-consanguineous parents to carry the same abnormal gene, which increases the risk to have children with a rare recessive genetic disorder. \n Achondrogenesis type IA is caused by mutations in the  TRIP11  gene. Achondrogenesis type IB is caused by mutations in the  SLC26A2  gene. These two genes are required for the efficient cellular transport of certain cartilage proteins needed to build skeleton and other tissues. Mutations of the  TRIP11  gene results in deficiency of the Golgi microtubule associated protein 210. This protein is found in most cell types of the body. The protein product of the  SLC26A2  gene is a sulfate transporter that is involved in the proper development and function of cartilage. Cartilage is the specialized tissue that serves as a buffer or cushion at joints. Most of the skeleton of an embryo consists of cartilage, which is slowly converted into bone. \n The gene mutation that causes achondrogenesis type II is caused by so called autosomal dominant change in the  COL2A1  gene. Dominant genetic disorders occur when only a single copy of an abnormal gene is necessary to cause a particular disease. Most cases of achondrogenesis type II are caused by a new ( de novo ) mutation in the  COL2A1  gene, which means that risk for the parents of an affected infant to get another child with the same disease is not higher then 1%. This gene encodes collagen type II. Collagen is one of the most abundant proteins in the body and a major building block of connective tissue, which is the material between cells of the body that gives the tissue form and strength. There are many different types of collagen, which are indicated by Roman numerals. Collagen type II is most prevalent in cartilage and the jelly-like fluid that fills the center of the eye (vitreous). Collagen is also found in bone. \n There are very rare cases where siblings of infants with achondrogenesis type II have been affected. This is most likely due to the presence of more than one cell line in the egg or sperm from a parent (germline mosaicism). In germline mosaicism, some of a parent’s reproductive cells (germ cells) carry the  COL2A1  gene mutation, while other germ cells contain normal  COL2A1  genes (“mosaicism”). The other cells in the parent’s body do not have the mutation, so these parents are unaffected. As a result, one or more of the parent’s children may inherit the germ cell gene  COL2A1  mutation, leading to the development of achondrogenesis II, while the parent does not have this disorder (asymptomatic carrier). Germline mosaicism may be suspected when apparently unaffected parents have more than one child with the same autosomal dominant genetic condition. The likelihood of a parent passing on a mosaic germline mutation to a child depends upon the percentage of the parent’s germ cells that have the mutation versus the percentage that do not. There is no test for germline mutation prior to pregnancy. Testing during early pregnancy may be available and is best discussed directly with a genetic specialist.",
    "treatment": "Standard Therapies \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    Treatment  \n Treatment of achondrogenesis is symptomatic and supportive and involves palliative care, in which physicians attempt to reduce or minimize pain, stress and specific symptoms associated with the disorder. Genetic counseling is recommended for families with an affected child. Psychosocial support for the entire family is essential as well.",

    "name": "Acquired Aplastic Anemia",
    "introduction": "General Discussion \n\t\t\t\t\t\tSummary\r\n Acquired aplastic anemia is a rare, serious blood disorder, due to failure of the bone marrow failure to produce blood cells. Bone marrow is the spongy substance found in the center of the bones of the body, in adults mainly the spine, pelvis, and large bones of the legs. The bone marrow contains hematopoietic stem cells. Stem cells can produce more stem cells (self-renewal) and also differentiate and proliferate, giving rise to red blood cells (erythrocytes), white blood cells (leukocytes), and platelets. In acquired aplastic anemia, an almost complete absence of hematopoietic stem cells results in low levels of red and white blood cells and platelets (pancytopenia). Symptoms of aplastic anemia are those of anemia, bleeding, and infection. Although bone marrow failure can occur secondary to other disorders, most aplastic anemia is due to the immune system mistakenly targeting the bone marrow (autoimmunity). Indeed, most patients can respond to therapy that suppresses the immune system, usually ATG and cyclosporine. \r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n Aplastic anemia is classified as severe according to blood counts. Most of the discussion that follows relates to severe aplastic anemia. Patients with more moderately decreased blood counts; may not require treatment. Furthermore, some aplastic anemia that is genetically inherited may, first manifest in adulthood, sometimes without a family history of blood disease.",
    "symptoms": "Signs &amp; Symptoms \n\t\t\t\t\t\t   The symptoms of acquired aplastic anemia occur as a consequence of the bone marrow failing to produce enough functioning blood cells. The specific symptoms and progression of the disorder vary from case to case. Some individuals may have mild symptoms that remain stable for many years; others may have serious symptoms that can progress to life-threatening complications. \n Red and white blood cells and platelets are formed in the bone marrow. The cells are released into the bloodstream to travel throughout the body performing their specific functions. Red blood cells deliver oxygen to the body, white blood cells help in fighting infections and platelets allow the body to form clots to stop bleeding. A low level of circulating red blood cells is known as anemia. A low level of white blood cells is known as leukopenia. A low level of platelets is known as thrombocytopenia. \n Individuals with anemia may experience tiredness, increased need for sleep, weakness, lightheadedness, dizziness, irritability, headaches, pale skin color, difficulty breathing (dyspnea), and cardiac symptoms. Individuals with leukopenia have an increase in risk of contracting bacterial and fungal infections. Individuals with thrombocytopenia are more susceptible to excessive bruising following minimal injury and to spontaneous bleeding from the mucous membranes, especially those of the gums and nose. Women may develop increased menstrual blood loss (menorrhagia). Symptoms are dependent on the severity of the anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. \n Some individuals with acquired aplastic anemia also have another disorder at the same time, called paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Acquired aplastic and PNH have a close relationship that is not fully understood by researchers. It is believed that PNH arises in the setting of autoimmune acquired aplastic anemia and bone marrow failure. Individuals affected with acquired aplastic anemia are also at risk that it will evolve into another similar disorder known as myelodysplasia. In a minority of cases, acquired aplastic anemia may eventually evolve into leukemia. PNH is caused by an acquired genetic defect affecting the PIGA gene, limited to the stem cells. The PIGA gene mutations cause blood cells to become sensitive to increased destruction by complement, a blood immunity protein. Twenty percent or more of patients with aplastic anemia have evidence of PNH at presentation, as detected by flow cytometry. Furthermore, patients who respond following immunosuppressive therapy frequently recover with clonal hematopiesis and PNH. There are a minority of MDS patients with hypoplastic or low cellularity bone marrow, as seen in acquired aplastic anemia. These conditions are often mistaken for each other, so whether one is transformed to another is uncertain. (For more information on these disorders, see the Related Disorders section of this report.)",
    "causes": "Causes \n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Most cases of acquired aplastic anemia occur unrelated to any identifiable causes, or for unknown reasons (idiopathic). Researchers believe that most are due to the immune system mistakenly targeting the bone marrow (autoimmunity). Autoimmune disorders are caused when the body’s natural defenses against “foreign” or invading organisms begin to attack healthy tissue for unknown reasons. Tests to confirm this in any individual case are not very readily available, but there is much evidence to support this pathogenic mechanism. \n The bone marrow contains specialized cells called hematopoietic stem cells. These stem cells eventually divide, differentiate and become red or white blood cells or platelets. In aplastic anemia, a precipitating event is hypothesized to trigger immune-mediated destruction of hematopoietic stem cells. It is believe that certain immune system cells (T-lymphocytes) target and destroy the most primitive cells capable of developing into blood cells, hematopoietic stem cells. Individuals with aplastic anemia do not have enough stem cells to produce mature blood cells. The bone marrow appears to be replaced by fat. Affected individuals eventually develop a deficiency of red and white blood cells and platelets (pancytopenia). \n In the past, acquired aplastic anemia has been linked to a variety of environmental factors including exposure to toxic environmental chemicals such as benzene, pesticides or insecticides; the use of certain drugs; and certain viral infections, especially hepatitis. These environmental factors are believed to trigger the immune system response that mistakenly destroys hematopoietic stem cells. However, most cases of acquired aplastic anemia have no identifiable environmental trigger.",
    "treatment": "Standard Therapies \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    Treatment  \n Treatment of acquired aplastic anemia varies, depending upon the individual’s age, general health, and the severity of aplastic anemia. Treatment aims to correct the bone marrow failure, as well as to treat the patient’s immediate signs and symptoms. The two main forms of specific treatment are bone marrow transplantation and immunosuppressive therapies. \n Initial treatment of acquired aplastic anemia may be directed toward improving the symptoms that may result from low blood counts. Such treatment consists of giving red blood cell transfusions to correct anemia, platelet transfusions to treat or prevent serious bleeding, and antibiotics to treat or prevent infections. \n Bone marrow transplantation, specifically an allogeneic transplant, is the treatment of choice in children and younger adults. With allogeneic bone marrow transplant, an affected individual’s abnormal bone marrow cells are eradicated or destroyed by chemotherapy and/or radiation, and replaced with healthy marrow obtained from a donor. The donor marrow is transplanted by injecting the cells of the donor intravenously into the patient’s body, where it travels to the patient’s bone marrow and eventually begins producing new blood cells. The best match for a bone marrow transplant is an identical twin, sibling or close relative who shares most of the same genetic makeup as the patient. However, in many cases, a search for an unrelated, matched donor is necessary. \n A similar procedure called peripheral hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may also be used to treat individuals with acquired aplastic anemia. In this procedure, healthy stem cells are taken from a donor by collecting them from the donor’s bloodstream rather than the bone marrow. These are then injected intravenously into the patient’s bloodstream. However, marrow is strongly preferred to blood as a source of stem cells in aplastic anemia. \n Graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease are potential complications with any transplant procedures, including bone marrow transplant. Complications of graft-versus-host disease from a bone marrow transplant may range from mild to life threatening. Drugs may be used to prevent or treat graft rejection or graft-versus-host disease. (For more information on this disorder, choose “graft versus host disease” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.) \n Individuals who are not candidates for a bone marrow transplant, either because of advanced age or lack of a suitable donor, are usually treated with immunosuppressive treatment. In this case, drugs are used to suppress the activity of the immune system. Since many cases of acquired aplastic anemia are believed to result from an individual’s immune system mistakenly attacking bone marrow, suppressing the activity of the immune system often allows the bone marrow to recover and eventually to begin producing new blood cells. The two most commonly used immunosuppressive agents, given alone or in combination, are antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine. Horse ATG is more effective than rabbit ATG in the treatment of aplastic anemia. \n Immunosuppressive therapy can restore an affected individual’s blood count to normal or near normal levels for prolonged periods. However, the improvement may not be permanent and the treatment must be repeated if relapses of aplastic anemia occur. In addition, individuals who successfully respond to immunosuppressive therapy are still at risk of eventually developing PNH, myelodysplasia, or leukemia. \n Approximately one-third of individuals treated with immunosuppressive drugs do not respond to therapy (refractory aplastic anemia). In these cases, treatment with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be considered. In some cases, treatment of refractory aplastic anemia with growth factors had led to clinically beneficial improvement in blood cell countsIn 2014, Promacta (eltrombopag) was approved to treat patients with severe aplastic anemia who have had an insufficient response to immunosuppressive therapy and are not candidates for a hematopoietic stem cell transplant.",

    "name": "Acidemia, Methylmalonic",
    "introduction": "General Discussion \n\t\t\t\t\t\t The methylmalonic acidemias are organic acidemias caused by an enzymatic defect in the metabolism of four amino acids (methionine, threonine, isoleucine and valine). This results in an abnormally high level of acid in the blood (academia) and body tissues. In the acute form, drowsiness, coma, and seizures may occur. Mental retardation is a long-term consequence. The disorder may be caused by a deficiency of one or more of the enzymes methylmalonyl CoA mutase, methylmalonyl racemase, or adenosylcobalamin synthetic enzymes. Excretion of methylmalonate, a product of amino acid metabolism, in the urine is abnormally high and therefore is a marker of the disorder. All known organic acidemias are inherited as autosomal recessive traits.",
    "symptoms": "Signs &amp; Symptoms \n\t\t\t\t\t\t   The onset of the Methylmalonic Acidemias usually occurs during the first few months of life although onset to late childhoods has been described.   Symptoms may include lethargy, failure to thrive, recurrent vomiting, acidosis, dehydration, respiratory distress, diminished muscle tone, developmental retardation, seizures and/or an enlarged liver. \n Laboratory findings include an abnormally high amount of methylmalonic acid in the blood and urine.  Metabolic acidosis also occurs.  Elevated levels of ketone bodies such as acetone in the blood (ketonemia) or in the urine (ketonuria) may develop.  An elevated level of ammonia in the blood (hyperammonemia) may also be present.   Excessive levels of the amino acid, glycine in the blood (hyperglycinemia) and in the urine (hyperglycinuria) is found.  The concentration of white blood cells, blood platelets and red blood cells may be lower than normal.  Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) may also occur.",
    "causes": "Causes \n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Researchers at the University of Calgary and McGill University in Canada announced in December 2002 that they had identified genes that underlie two severe forms of methylmalonic academia.  This discovery should make possible DNA testing for carriers and prenatal diagnosis, which is important because treatment can be started during pregnancy. \n All known organic acidemias are inherited as autosomal recessive traits.  Human traits including the classic genetic diseases are the product of the interaction of two genes, one received from the father and one from the mother.  In recessive disorders, the condition does not appear unless a person inherits the same defective gene for the same trait from each parent.  If an individual receives one normal gene and one gene for the disease, the person will be a carrier for the disease, but usually will not show symptoms.  The risk of transmitting the disease to the children of a couple, both of whom are carriers for a recessive disorder, is 25 percent.   On average, 50 percent of their children will be carriers of the disease but will not show symptoms of the disorder, while 25 percent will receive a normal copy of the gene from each parent.  These risks are the same for each pregnancy.",
    "treatment": "Standard Therapies \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    Treatment  \n The diet of children with Methylmalonic Acidemias must be carefully controlled. Treatment includes a low-protein diet and avoidance of the amino acids isoleucine, valine, threonine and methionine. To assure a balanced diet, certain medical foods must be fed to affected children. Massive doses of vitamin B12 are indicated in the B12-responsive variants. In the disorders of cobalamin metabolism, administration of intramuscular and/or oral hydroxycobalamin may correct the defect and restore normal metabolism. \n Genetic counseling is recommended for the families of children with Methylmalonic Acidemias.",

    "introduction": "General Discussion \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAchalasia is a rare disorder of the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach. It is characterized by impaired ability to push food down toward the stomach (peristalsis), failure of the ring-shaped muscle at the bottom of the esophagus, the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), to relax. It is the contraction and relaxation of the sphincter that moves food through the tube.",
    "symptoms": "Signs &amp; Symptoms \n\t\t\t\t\t\t   The symptoms of achalasia typically appear gradually. Most people with this disorder experience an impairment in the ability to swallow (dysphagia) as a major and early symptom. There may also be mild chest pain that comes and goes. Some affected individuals experience pain that is very intense. \n Retention of saliva and ingested food in the esophagus may often cause regurgitation of these contents; in addition, such contents may also be propelled into the lungs during breathing (tracheobronchial aspiration). Other symptoms of this disorder may include a cough during the night and significant weight loss, because of difficulty in swallowing, in cases that remain untreated. Dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis sicca) and dry mouth (xerostomia) are not unusual in patients with achalasia. \n The aspiration of saliva and food contents by people with achalasia may cause pneumonia, other pulmonary infections, or even death. The incidence of esophageal cancer is significantly increased in patients with achalasia.",
    "causes": "Causes \n\t\t\t\t\t\t   The exact cause of achalasia is not known.

    "treatment": "Standard Therapies \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    Treatment  \n The treatment of achalasia is aimed at removing obstructions caused by the failure of the lower esophageal sphincter muscle to relax. This may be done with the administration of drugs, expanding the cross-section (manual dilation) of the sphincter muscle, or through surgery. \n The drug isosorbide, (a long-acting nitrate) or nifedipine (a calcium channel blocker) may provide some relief for people with achalasia. \n Approximately 70 percent of cases of achalasia may be treated effectively by the enlargement of the lower esophageal sphincter muscle through a procedure known as pneumatic balloon dilation. In many people, repeated dilations may be necessary to obtain improvement of symptoms. \n Surgical treatments of achalasia may be effective in approximately 85-90 percent of cases. During these procedures, the muscle fibers in the lower esophageal sphincter are cut (laparoscopic Heller myotomy or peroral endoscopic myotomy). About 15 percent of people with achalasia experience the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux after this surgical procedure.",

An autosomal dominant genetic trait, achondroplasia occurs as a result of a fresh (new) spontaneous change (mutation) in genetic material in about 90 percent of cases. In achondroplasia, affected individuals have impaired ability to form bone from cartilage (endochondral bone formation).",
    "symptoms": "Signs &amp; Symptoms \n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Achondroplasia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by an unusually large head (macrocephaly) with a prominent forehead (frontal bossing) and flat (depressed) nasal bridge, short upper arms and legs (rhizomelic dwarfism), unusually prominent abdomen and buttocks, and short hands with fingers that assume a “trident” or three-pronged position during extension.  \n Infants born with achondroplasia typically have an arched or “dome-like” (vaulted) skull to adapt to the abnormally enlarged brain (megalencephaly) that is characteristic in this syndrome.  This results in a very broad forehead.  Excessive accumulation of fluid around the brain (hydrocephalus) may also be present.  Compression of the brain stem may occur in some children with achondroplasia resulting in a life-threatening condition.   (For more information on this disorder, choose “Hydrocephalus” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.) \n Infants with achondroplasia typically have a flat (depressed) nasal bridge.  Arms and legs are usually very short and the trunk of the body appears long in comparison.  The hands of children with this disorder are generally short and broad.  The index and middle finger are typically close together as are the ring finger and the pinkie, giving the hand a three pronged (trident) appearance.  An abnormal condition of the spine characterized by the outward (convex) curvature of the upper back (dorsal kyphosis) is usually present in children with this disorder and their legs may be bowed.  Most adult males with Achondroplasia are under, 4 feet 6 inches tall, while females are typically 3 inches shorter than males. \n Children with achondroplasia may also have deformities of the rib cage including the excessive curvature or “cupping” of the ribs.  Achondroplasia does not cause any impairment or deficiencies in mental abilities.  The life expectancy of infants over the age of 12 months is normal.",
    "causes": "Causes \n\t\t\t\t\t\t   In most cases, achondroplasia appears to occur randomly for unknown reasons (sporadically) with no apparent family history.  According to researchers, many such cases may represent new (sporadic) genetic changes (mutations) that may be transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait (i.e., new dominant gene mutations).  Investigators indicate that increased age of the father (advanced paternal age) may be a contributing factor in cases of sporadic achondroplasia.   \n Less commonly, familial cases of achondroplasia have been reported.  In such instances, autosomal dominant inheritance has been demonstrated.  Human traits, including the classic genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes, one received from the father and one from the mother.  In dominant disorders, a single copy of the disease gene (received from either the mother or father) may be expressed “dominating” the other normal gene and resulting in the appearance of the disease.  The risk of transmitting the disorder from affected parent to offspring is 50 percent for each pregnancy regardless of the sex of the resulting child.  The risk is the same for each pregnancy. \n Achondroplasia has been shown to result from specific mutations of a gene known as “fibroblast growth factor receptor-3” (FGFR3).  The FGFR3 gene is located on the short arm (p) of chromosome 4 (4p16.3).  Chromosomes are found in the nucleus of all body cells.  They carry the genetic characteristics of each individual.  Pairs of human chromosomes are numbered from 1 through 22, with an unequal 23rd pair of X and Y chromosomes for males and two X chromosomes for females.  Each chromosome has a short arm designated as “p” and a long arm identified by the letter “q.”  Chromosomes are further subdivided into bands that are numbered.  Therefore, chromosome 4p16.3 refers to band 16.3 on the short arm of chromosome 4. \n Genetic analysis has also revealed that different mutations of the same gene (i.e., FGFR3) may cause a disorder known as hypochondroplasia, indicating that achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia are allelic disorders.  (An allele is one of two or more alternative forms of a gene that may occupy a particular chromosomal location.)  Hypochondroplasia is a form of short-limbed dwarfism that may be characterized by certain features similar to those seen in achondroplasia.  (For more information, please see the “Related Disorders” section of this report below.)",
    "treatment": "Standard Therapies \n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain in infancy may be done to determine the presence of hydrocephalus which is sometimes associated with achondroplasia. Orthopedic surgery and physical therapy may be beneficial in the management of this disorder. Genetic counseling may also be useful. \n Little People of America is an organization providing social services for persons with achondroplasia. The organization also acts as an advocate on their behalf (see Resources Section of this report). \n The Vertical Expandable Prosthetic Titanium Rib (VEPTR) was approved by the FDA in 2004 as a treatment for thoracic insufficiency syndrome (TIS) in pediatric patients. TIS, is a congenital condition where severe deformities of the chest, spine, and ribs prevent normal breathing and lung development. The VEPTR is an implanted, expandable device that helps straighten the spine and separate ribs so that the lungs can grow and fill with enough air to breathe. The length of the device can be adjusted as the patient grows. The titanium rib was developed at the University of Texas, Health Science Center in San Antonio.

The FGFR3 gene is located on the short arm (p) of chromosome 4 (4p16.3).  Chromosomes are found in the nucleus of all body cells.  They carry the genetic characteristics of each individual.  Pairs of human chromosomes are numbered from 1 through 22, with an unequal 23rd pair of X and Y chromosomes for males and two X chromosomes for females.  Each chromosome has a short arm designated as “p” and a long arm identified by the letter “q.”  Chromosomes are further subdivided into bands that are numbered.  Therefore, chromosome 4p16.3 refers to band 16.3 on the short arm of chromosome 4.</p>\n<p>Genetic analysis has also revealed that different mutations of the same gene (i.e., FGFR3) may cause a disorder known as hypochondroplasia, indicating that achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia are allelic disorders.  (An allele is one of two or more alternative forms of a gene that may occupy a particular chromosomal location.)  Hypochondroplasia is a form of short-limbed dwarfism that may be characterized by certain features similar to those seen in achondroplasia.

    "name": "Aceruloplasminemia",
    "introduction": "General Discussion \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Aceruloplasminemia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the abnormal accumulation of iron in the brain and various internal organs. Affected individuals develop neurological symptoms including cognitive impairment and movement disorders. Degeneration of the retina and diabetes may also occur. Symptoms usually become apparent during adulthood between 20 and 60 years of age. Aceruloplasminemia is caused by mutations of the ceruloplasmin (CP) gene. This mutation is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. \r\n Aceruloplasminemia is classified as a Neurodegenerative disorder with Brain Iron Accumulation (NBIA). NBIA are a group of rare inherited disorders characterized by iron accumulation in the brain. Aceruloplasminemia is also classified as an iron overload disorder.",
    "symptoms": "Signs &amp; Symptoms \n\t\t\t\t\t\t   The symptoms and severity of aceruloplasminemia vary from one person to another even among members of the same family. The age of onset varies as well, ranging from anywhere between the 20s and 60s. The three main findings associated with aceruloplasminemia are retinal degeneration, neurological symptoms and diabetes mellitus. \n Some individuals with aceruloplasminemia develop mild anemia (low levels of circulating red blood cells), which can cause fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath and pale skin. Anemia often occurs before the development of other symptoms commonly associated with aceruloplasminemia. \n Many affected individuals develop progressive degeneration of the retinas. The retinas are the thin layers of nerve cells that line the inner surface of the eyes. The retinas sense light and convert it to nerve signals, which are then relayed to the brain through the optic nerve. The damage to the retinal tissue can result from iron deposition or be related to the diabetes that develops as part of aceruloplasminemia. \n A variety of neurological symptoms occur in individuals with aceruloplasminemia because of the accumulation of iron in the brain. Specific symptoms may vary, but often include movement disorders, an inability to coordinate voluntary movements (ataxia), slurred speech or difficulty speaking (dysarthria), behavioral changes and cognitive impairment. \n Movement disorders associated with aceruloplasminemia include tremors, chorea (rapid, involuntary, jerky movements) and dystonia, which refers to a group of muscle disorders generally characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that force the body into abnormal, sometimes painful, movements and positions (postures). An example of dystonia is blepharospasm, a condition characterized by involuntary muscle spasms and contractions of the muscles around the eyes. \n Some affected individuals develop symptoms may resemble those found in Parkinson’s disease, which is sometimes referred to as Parkinsonism. These symptoms include tremors, abnormal slowness of movement and an inability to remain in a stable or balanced position. Some individuals with aceruloplasminemia develop cognitive impairment, which can progress to dementia. Behavioral or emotional changes (e.g., depression) may also occur. \n Iron accumulation in individuals with aceruloplasminemia may also occur in the pancreas. The pancreas is a small organ located behind the stomach that secretes enzymes that travel to the intestines and aid in digestion. The pancreas also secretes other hormones such as insulin, which helps break down sugar. Damage to the pancreas may ultimately lead to diabetes mellitus. Diabetes is a common disorder in which the body does not produce enough or is unable to properly use insulin. Therefore, the body is not able to properly convert nutrients into the energy necessary for daily activities. The most obvious symptoms are unusually excessive thirst and urination.",
    "causes": "Causes \n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Aceruloplasminemia is caused by mutations of the ceruloplasmin (CP) gene. It is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Genetic diseases are determined by the combination of genes for a particular trait that are on the chromosomes received from the father and the mother. \n Recessive genetic disorders occur when an individual inherits the same abnormal gene for the same trait from each parent. If an individual receives one normal gene and one gene for the disease, the person will be a carrier for the disease, but usually will not show symptoms. The risk for two carrier parents to both pass the defective gene and, therefore, have an affected child is 25 percent with each pregnancy. The risk to have a child who is a carrier like the parents is 50 percent with each pregnancy. The chance for a child to receive normal genes from both parents and be genetically normal for that particular trait is 25 percent. The risk is the same for males and females. In most recessive conditions individuals with one normal gene and one gene for the disease (carriers) do not develop symptoms, however, in aceruloplasminemia carriers may, in rare cases develop cerebellar ataxia (problems coordinating movements). \n Investigators have determined that the CP gene is located on the long arm (q) of chromosome 3 (3q23-q24). Chromosomes, which are present in the nucleus of human cells, carry the genetic information for each individual. Human body cells normally have 46 chromosomes. Pairs of human chromosomes are numbered from 1 through 22 and the sex chromosomes are designated X and Y. Males have one X and one Y chromosome and females have two X chromosomes. Each chromosome has a short arm designated “p” and a long arm designated “q”. Chromosomes are further sub-divided into many bands that are numbered. For example, “chromosome 3q23-q24” refers to bands 23-24 on the long arm of chromosome 3. The numbered bands specify the location of the thousands of genes that are present on each chromosome. \n The CP gene contains instructions for producing the enzyme ceruloplasmin. This enzyme is essential for the proper function and transport of iron within the body. Mutations of the CP gene result in deficient levels of functional ceruloplasmin, which ultimately results in the accumulation of iron in the brain and other organs of the body. Iron accumulation damages the tissue of affected organs causing the characteristic symptoms of aceruloplasminemia. \n Iron is a critical mineral that is found in all cells of the body and is essential for the body to function and grow properly. Iron is found many types of food including red meat, poultry, eggs and vegetables. Iron levels must remain in a specific range within the body, otherwise they can cause anemia (due to low iron levels) or damage affected organs (due to high iron levels). \n In most individuals with aceruloplasminemia, iron accumulates within the basal ganglia, a part of the brain that consists of three clusters of brain cells (neurons). The basal ganglia processes information involved in involuntary movements, coordination and cognition. The specific neurological symptoms that develop in aceruloplasminemia depend on the exact location and extent of iron accumulation within the brain. \n Diabetes associated with aceruloplasminemia results from iron accumulation in the pancreas. Iron can also accumulate elsewhere in the body such as the retinas or liver. Liver damage does not occur in aceruloplasminemia.",
    "treatment": "Standard Therapies \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    Treatment  \n The treatment of aceruloplasminemia is directed toward the specific symptoms that are apparent in each individual. Individuals with aceruloplasminemia may be treated with a drug called desferrioxamine, an iron chelator. Iron chelators are drugs that bind to the excess iron in the body allowing it to be dissolved in water and excreted from the body through the kidneys. Desferrioxamine has decreased iron in the brain and liver and prevented the progression of neurological symptoms in symptomatic individuals with blood iron levels greater than 9 grams per deciliter (g/dL). \n Individuals with aceruloplasminemia should avoid substances that increase the levels of iron in the body. \n Genetic counseling may be of benefit for affected individuals and their families. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Of particular importance is management of diabetes, with appropriate diet, tablets and insulin injects as needed.",

    "name": "Acanthosis Nigricans",
    "introduction": "General Discussion \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Acanthosis nigricans (AN) is a skin condition characterized by abnormally increased coloration (hyperpigmentation) and \"velvety\" thickening (hyperkeratosis) of the skin, particularly of skin fold regions, such as of the neck and groin and under the arms (axillae). Various benign (non-cancerous) forms of AN have been identified in which the disorder may be inherited as a primary condition or associated with various underlying syndromes, an excess accumulation of body fat (obesity), or the use of certain medications (i.e., drug-induced AN). In other instances, AN may occur in association with an underlying cancerous tumor (i.e., malignant AN).  Experts suggest that AN, may be a skin manifestation of insulin resistance, which is a condition characterized by impaired biological responses to insulin. Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, regulates blood glucose levels by promoting the movement of glucose into cells for energy production or into the liver and fat cells for energy storage. (Glucose is a simple sugar that is the body's primary source of energy for cell metabolism.) Some clinicians suggest that insulin resistance causes a build-up of the hormone in the blood and then it finds its way into skin cells. Insulin resistance may be associated with various disorders, including obesity and non-insulin-dependent (type II) diabetes mellitus. In individuals with type II diabetes mellitus, the pancreas produces insulin but the body becomes resistant to its effects, leading to insufficient absorption of glucose and abnormally increased glucose levels in the blood (hyperglycemia) and urine. As a result, there may be a gradual onset of certain symptoms, including excessive urination (polyuria) and increased thirst (polydipsia), and the development of particular complications without appropriate treatment.",
    "symptoms": "Signs &amp; Symptoms \n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Acanthosis nigricans (AN) is characterized by increased coloration or pigmentation (hyperpigmentation) and abnormal thickening of the skin.  The most commonly affected areas include the sides and back of the neck, under the arms (axillae), the groin, and the anal/genital region.  In some instances, other body fold (i.e., flexure) regions may also be involved, such as behind the knees, in front of the elbows, under the breasts, and/or the navel (umbilicus) region.  There have also been some reports in which almost all of the skin is affected. \n In individuals with AN, initial changes may include the development of greyish brown or black pigmentation, excessive roughness and dryness, and noticeable thickening or overgrowth (hyperkeratosis) of the skin.  Affected areas are covered with relatively small, elevated, “warty” (verrucous) tissue growths (papillomatous elevations), resulting in an unusual, velvety texture.  With increasing skin thickening, regional skin lines become more accentuated, the skin surface may appear unusually wrinkled or ridged; and larger, wart-like outgrowths develop. \n Benign AN may occur as a primary, isolated condition (known as hereditary benign AN) or be associated with various underlying disorders, conditions, or syndromes.  (For more information, please see the “Causes” section of this report below.)  In some cases of benign AN, associated skin abnormalities may be present at birth (congenital).  However, they more commonly appear during childhood or puberty.  The skin changes tend to develop slowly, may worsen during adolescence, and eventually stabilize or improve.  In some affected individuals, the skin abnormalities may affect only one side of the body (unilateral).  In addition, reports suggest that involvement is typically less severe and extensive than that seen in malignant AN (see below).  \n A benign variant of AN has also been described in which the condition occurs as a reversible skin manifestation associated with obesity.  Known as “pseudoacanthosis nigricans,” the condition is thought to be most frequent in African-American or Hispanic individuals.  Associated findings include relatively small regions of increased pigmentation and thickening as well as outgrowths of skin (skin tags) in body folds, particularly the groin, under the arms, and the cleft between the buttocks where the anus opens (anal or natal cleft).  Reports suggest that certain skin changes may improve with weight loss; however, pigmentary abnormalities may tend to remain. \n Benign AN has also been described in association with the use of certain medications.  For further information on drug-induced AN, please see the “Causes” section below. \n In some instances, AN occurs in association with an underlying cancerous tumor.  Known as “malignant AN,” this form of the condition is most common in adults, particularly those over age 40, and appears to affect men and women relatively equally.  The underlying malignancy is often derived from glandular tissue (adenocarcinoma), particularly of the stomach (gastric adenocarcinoma), or, less commonly, the intestines, pancreas, uterus, lung, ovary, bladder, breast, or prostate.  Rarely, AN may occur in association with malignancy of the lymphatic system (lymphoma). \n In individuals with malignant AN, skin changes are typically more extensive and severe than seen in benign AN.  Findings may include thickening, unusual roughness and dryness, and/or potentially severe itching (pruritus) and irritation of affected skin regions.  Pigmentary changes may be more pronounced than seen in benign AN and are not restricted to areas of hyperkeratosis.  Malignant AN is also frequently associated with involvement of the mucous membranes and distinctive abnormalities of the mouth (oral) region.  For example, reports indicate that there may be an unusually “shaggy” appearance of the lips and the back and sides of the tongue, potentially with elevated, wart-like, non-pigmented tissue growths (papillomatous elevations).  Malignant AN is also commonly characterized by wart-like thickening around the eyes; unusual ridging or brittleness of the nails; thickening of the skin on the palms of the hands; hair loss; and/or other symptoms.  Investigators indicate that the development of malignant AN, may occur as much as five years before the onset of other symptoms, although the time span is typically of shorter duration.",
    "causes": "Causes \n\t\t\t\t\t\t   A variety of medically related factors can cause acanthosis nigricans.  However, it can also appear in otherwise healthy individuals. Acanthosis nigricans is most commonly found in people of African descent and some cases are genetically inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. (Only one parent needs to have an abnormal gene in order for the child to inherit the disease.)  \n The medically related factors of AN include diabetes. Obesity, which leads to diabetes and other endocrine disorders, is also a medically related cause.  Certain drugs such as human growth hormone or oral contraceptives can be a cause. Lymphoma or cancers of the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract have been known to bring on severe cases of AN.",
    "treatment": "Standard Therapies \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    Treatment  \n The treatment of acanthosis nigricans (AN) is directed toward the specific symptoms that are apparent in each individual. Such treatment may require the coordinated efforts of a team of medical professionals. Depending on the age at symptom onset, the form of AN present, and/or the condition's underlying cause, such medical professionals may include pediatricians or internists; physicians who specialize in skin disorders (dermatologists); endocrine disorder specialists (endocrinologists); physicians who diagnose and treat cancer (medical oncologists), physicians who specialize in the use of radiation to treat cancers (radiation oncologists), surgeons, dietitians; and/or other professionals. \n AN may resolve with therapy directed toward correcting or managing an underlying disorder or other causative condition, such as appropriate hormone replacement therapy for those with certain endocrine disorders; removal of medications that may cause drug-induced AN, if possible; and/or other measures to help reduce insulin resistance. In addition, in some cases, such as for those with insulin resistance associated with diabetes mellitus, disease management may include making appropriate dietary adjustments; regularly monitoring blood levels; taking certain medications by mouth (orally), receiving appropriate insulin replacement therapy; and/or other measures. As mentioned above, for those with pseudoacanthosis nigricans, sufficient weight loss under a physician's care may improve certain skin changes associated with AN. However, the pigmentary changes may tend to persist. In addition, for some with AN, recommended treatment may include the use of certain synthetic, vitamin A-like compounds (retinoids) administered by mouth or applied to the skin (topically). \n For individuals with malignant AN, disease management requires treatment by cancer specialists (oncologists). Depending upon the specific form, stage, and grade of the malignancy and other factors, recommended treatment may include surgical removal of the malignancy; administration of certain anticancer drugs (chemotherapy); radiation therapy, and/or other measures. During radiation therapy, radiation (via x-rays or other sources of radioactivity) is passed through selected regions of the body to destroy cancer cells and shrink tumors. Reports indicate that AN has improved with therapy to treat underlying malignancies and has reappeared with tumor recurrences. \n Genetic counseling may sometimes be of benefit for affected individuals and their families (e.g., for those with hereditary benign AN, or other underlying genetic causes of AN). Other treatment for this disorder is symptomatic and supportive.",

Affected areas are covered with relatively small, elevated, “warty” (verrucous) tissue growths (papillomatous elevations), resulting in an unusual, velvety texture.  With increasing skin thickening, regional skin lines become more accentuated, the skin surface may appear unusually wrinkled or ridged; and larger, wart-like outgrowths develop.</p>\n<p>Benign AN may occur as a primary, isolated condition (known as hereditary benign AN) or be associated with various underlying disorders, conditions, or syndromes.  (For more information, please see the “Causes” section of this report below.)  In some cases of benign AN, associated skin abnormalities may be present at birth (congenital).  However, they more commonly appear during childhood or puberty.  The skin changes tend to develop slowly, may worsen during adolescence, and eventually stabilize or improve.  In some affected individuals, the skin abnormalities may affect only one side of the body (unilateral).  In addition, reports suggest that involvement is typically less severe and extensive than that seen in malignant AN (see below). </p>\n<p>A benign variant of AN has also been described in which the condition occurs as a reversible skin manifestation associated with obesity.  Known as “pseudoacanthosis nigricans,” the condition is thought to be most frequent in African-American or Hispanic individuals.  Associated findings include relatively small regions of increased pigmentation and thickening as well as outgrowths of skin (skin tags) in body folds, particularly the groin, under the arms, and the cleft between the buttocks where the anus opens (anal or natal cleft).  Reports suggest that certain skin changes may improve with weight loss; however, pigmentary abnormalities may tend to remain.</p>\n<p>Benign AN has also been described in association with the use of certain medications.  For further information on drug-induced AN, please see the “Causes” section below.</p>\n<p>In some instances, AN occurs in association with an underlying cancerous tumor.  Known as “malignant AN,” this form of the condition is most common in adults, particularly those over age 40, and appears to affect men and women relatively equally.  The underlying malignancy is often derived from glandular tissue (adenocarcinoma), particularly of the stomach (gastric adenocarcinoma), or, less commonly, the intestines, pancreas, uterus, lung, ovary, bladder, breast, or prostate.  Rarely, AN may occur in association with malignancy of the lymphatic system (lymphoma).</p>\n<p>In individuals with malignant AN, skin changes are typically more extensive and severe than seen in benign AN.  Findings may include thickening, unusual roughness and dryness, and/or potentially severe itching (pruritus) and irritation of affected skin regions.  Pigmentary changes may be more pronounced than seen in benign AN and are not restricted to areas of hyperkeratosis.  Malignant AN is also frequently associated with involvement of the mucous membranes and distinctive abnormalities of the mouth (oral) region.  For example, reports indicate that there may be an unusually “shaggy” appearance of the lips and the back and sides of the tongue, potentially with elevated, wart-like, non-pigmented tissue growths (papillomatous elevations).  Malignant AN is also commonly characterized by wart-like thickening around the eyes; unusual ridging or brittleness of the nails; thickening of the skin on the palms of the hands; hair loss; and/or other symptoms.  Investigators indicate that the development of malignant AN, may occur as much as five years before the onset of other symptoms, although the time span is typically of shorter duration.</p>\n</div></div>\t\t\t\t\t</div>",

However, it can also appear in otherwise healthy individuals. Acanthosis nigricans is most commonly found in people of African descent and some cases are genetically inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. (Only one parent needs to have an abnormal gene in order for the child to inherit the disease.) </p>\n<p>The medically related factors of AN include diabetes. Obesity, which leads to diabetes and other endocrine disorders, is also a medically related cause.  Certain drugs such as human growth hormone or oral contraceptives can be a cause. Lymphoma or cancers of the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract have been known to bring on severe cases of AN.</p>\n</div></div>\t\t\t\t\t</div>",

Such treatment may require the coordinated efforts of a team of medical professionals. Depending on the age at symptom onset, the form of AN present, and/or the condition's underlying cause, such medical professionals may include pediatricians or internists; physicians who specialize in skin disorders (dermatologists); endocrine disorder specialists (endocrinologists); physicians who diagnose and treat cancer (medical oncologists), physicians who specialize in the use of radiation to treat cancers (radiation oncologists), surgeons, dietitians; and/or other professionals.</p>\n<p>AN may resolve with therapy directed toward correcting or managing an underlying disorder or other causative condition, such as appropriate hormone replacement therapy for those with certain endocrine disorders; removal of medications that may cause drug-induced AN, if possible; and/or other measures to help reduce insulin resistance. In addition, in some cases, such as for those with insulin resistance associated with diabetes mellitus, disease management may include making appropriate dietary adjustments; regularly monitoring blood levels; taking certain medications by mouth (orally), receiving appropriate insulin replacement therapy; and/or other measures. As mentioned above, for those with pseudoacanthosis nigricans, sufficient weight loss under a physician's care may improve certain skin changes associated with AN. However, the pigmentary changes may tend to persist. In addition, for some with AN, recommended treatment may include the use of certain synthetic, vitamin A-like compounds (retinoids) administered by mouth or applied to the skin (topically).</p>\n<p>For individuals with malignant AN, disease management requires treatment by cancer specialists (oncologists). Depending upon the specific form, stage, and grade of the malignancy and other factors, recommended treatment may include surgical removal of the malignancy; administration of certain anticancer drugs (chemotherapy); radiation therapy, and/or other measures. During radiation therapy, radiation (via x-rays or other sources of radioactivity) is passed through selected regions of the body to destroy cancer cells and shrink tumors. Reports indicate that AN has improved with therapy to treat underlying malignancies and has reappeared with tumor recurrences.</p>\n<p>Genetic counseling may sometimes be of benefit for affected individuals and their families (e.g., for those with hereditary benign AN, or other underlying genetic causes of AN). Other treatment for this disorder is symptomatic and supportive.</p>\n</div></div>\t\t\t\t\t</div>"
